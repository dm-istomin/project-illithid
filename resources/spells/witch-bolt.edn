Make a ranged spell attack against that creature. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 lightning damage, and on each of your turns for the duration, you can use your action to deal 1d12 lightning damage to the target automatically. The spell ends if you use your action to do anything else. The spell also ends if the target is ever outside the spellâ€™s range or if it has total cover from you.", :material-component "A twig from a tree that has been struck by lightning.", :ritual? false, :school :school/evocation, :name "Witch Bolt", :duration "Up to 1 minute", :level 1, :components #{:M :V :S}, :id :witch-bolt, :casting-time "1 action", :classes #{:sorcerer :wizard :warlock}, :range "30 feet"}
