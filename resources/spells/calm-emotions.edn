#:illithid.character.spell{:description "You attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group of people. Each humanoid in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must make a charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. If a creature fails its saving throw, choose one of the following two effects. You can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened. When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.\n\nAlternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the DM rules otherwise.", :material-component nil, :ritual? false, :school :school/enchantment, :name "Calm Emotions", :duration "Up to 1 minute", :level 2, :components #{:V :S}, :id :calm-emotions, :casting-time "1 action", :classes #{:cleric :warlock :bard}, :range "60 feet"}
