#:illithid.character.spell{:description "You choose nonmagical flame that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You affect it in one of the following ways:\n\n- You instantaneously expand the flame 5 feet in one direction, provided that wood or other fuel is present in the new location.\n\n- You instantaneously extinguish the flames within the cube.\n\n- You double or halve the area of bright light and dim light cast by the flame, change its color, or both. The change lasts for 1 hour.\n\n- You cause simple shapes-such as the vague form of a creature, an inanimate object, or a location-to appear within the flames and animate as you like. The shapes last for 1 hour.\n\nIf you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.", :material-component nil, :ritual? false, :school :school/transmutation, :name "Control Flames", :duration "Instantaneous/1 hour", :level 0, :components #{:S}, :id :control-flames, :casting-time "1 action", :classes #{:druid :sorcerer :wizard}, :range "60 feet"}
