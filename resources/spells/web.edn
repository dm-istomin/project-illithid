#:illithid.character.spell{:description "You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20-foot cube from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.\n\nIf the webs arenâ€™t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.\n\nEach creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.\n\nA creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.\n\nThe webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.", :material-component "A bit of spiderweb.", :ritual? false, :school :school/conjuration, :name "Web", :duration "Up to 1 hour", :level 2, :components #{:M :V :S}, :id :web, :casting-time "1 action", :classes #{:druid :sorcerer :wizard}, :range "60 feet"}
