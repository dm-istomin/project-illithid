#:illithid.character.spell{:description "Choose a manufactured metal object, such as a metal weapon or a suit of heavy or medium metal armor, that you can see within range. You cause the object to glow red-hot. Any creature in physical contact with the object takes 2d8 fire damage when you cast the spell. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to cause this damage again.\n\nIf a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes the damage from it, the creature must succeed on a constitution saving throw or drop the object if it can. If it doesnâ€™t drop the object, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.", :material-component "A piece of iron and a flame.", :ritual? false, :school :school/transmutation, :name "Heat Metal", :duration "Up to 1 minute", :level 2, :components #{:M :V :S}, :id :heat-metal, :casting-time "1 action", :classes #{:druid :bard}, :range "60 feet"}
