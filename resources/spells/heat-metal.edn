You cause the object to glow red-hot. Any creature in physical contact with the object takes 2d8 fire damage when you cast the spell. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to cause this damage again.

If a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes the damage from it, the creature must succeed on a constitution saving throw or drop the object if it can. If it doesnâ€™t drop the object, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.", :id :heat-metal, :illithid.character.spell/range"60 feet", :illithid.character.spell/school :school/transmutation}
