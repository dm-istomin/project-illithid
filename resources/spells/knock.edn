The object can be a door, a box, a chest, a set of manacles, a padlock, or another object that contains a mundane or magical means that prevents access.\n\nA target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or barred becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is unlocked.\n\nIf you choose a target that is held shut with arcane lock, that spell is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened and shut normally.\n\nWhen you cast the spell, a loud knock, audible from as far away as 300 feet, emanates from the target object.", :material-component nil, :ritual? false, :school :school/transmutation, :name "Knock", :duration "Instantaneous", :level 2, :components #{:V}, :id :knock, :casting-time "1 action", :classes #{:sorcerer :wizard :bard}, :range "60 feet"}
