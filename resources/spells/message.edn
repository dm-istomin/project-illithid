#:illithid.character.spell{:description "You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.\n\nYou can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesnâ€™t have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.", :material-component "A short piece of copper wire.", :ritual? false, :school :school/transmutation, :name "Message", :duration "1 round", :level 0, :components #{:M :V :S}, :id :message, :casting-time "1 action", :classes #{:sorcerer :wizard :bard}, :range "120 feet"}
