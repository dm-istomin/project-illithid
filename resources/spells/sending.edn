#:illithid.character.spell{:description "You send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with which you are familiar. The creature hears the message in its mind, recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. The spell enables creatures with Intelligence scores of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message.\n\nYou can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the message doesnâ€™t arrive.", :material-component "A short piece of fine copper wire.", :ritual? false, :school :school/evocation, :name "Sending", :duration "1 round", :level 3, :components #{:M :V :S}, :id :sending, :casting-time "1 action", :classes #{:cleric :wizard :warlock :bard}, :range "Unlimited"}
