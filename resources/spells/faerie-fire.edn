Any creature in the area when the spell is cast is also outlined in light if it fails a dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius.\n\nAny attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object canâ€™t benefit from being invisible.", :material-component nil, :ritual? false, :school :school/evocation, :name "Faerie Fire", :duration "Up to 1 minute", :level 1, :components #{:V}, :id :faerie-fire, :casting-time "1 action", :classes #{:cleric :druid :warlock :bard}, :range "60 feet"}
