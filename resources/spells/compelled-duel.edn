#:illithid.character.spell{:description "You attempt to compel a creature into a duel. One creature that you can see within range must make a wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is drawn to you, compelled by your divine demand. For the duration, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you, and must make a wisdom saving throw each time it attempts to move into a space that is more than 30 feet away from you; if it succeeds on this saving throw, the spell doesn’t restrict the target’s movement for that turn.\n\nThe spell ends if you attack any other creature, if you cast a spell that targets a hostile creature other than the target, if a creature friendly to you damages the target or casts a harmful spell on it, or if you end your turn more than 30 feet away from the target.", :material-component nil, :ritual? false, :school :school/enchantment, :name "Compelled Duel", :duration "Up to 1 minute", :level 1, :components #{:V}, :id :compelled-duel, :casting-time "1 bonus action", :classes #{:paladin}, :range "30 feet"}
