If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it canâ€™t be held or carried by an unwilling creature.\n\nThe destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully.
