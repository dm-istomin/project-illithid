The sphere remains for the duration, and its area is lightly obscured. The sphere's area is difficult terrain.\n\nWhen the area appears, each creature in it must make a constitution saving throw. A creature takes 4d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.", :material-component "A few grains of sugar, some kernels of grain, and a smear of fat.", :ritual? false, :school :school/conjuration, :name "Insect Plague", :duration "Up to 10 minutes", :level 5, :components #{:M :V :S}, :id :insect-plague, :casting-time "1 action", :classes #{:cleric :druid :sorcerer}, :range "300 feet"}
