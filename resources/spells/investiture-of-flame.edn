Until the spell ends, you gain the following benefits:\n\n- You are immune to fire damage and have resistance to cold damage.\n\n- Any creature that moves within 5 feet of you for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there takes 1d10 fire damage.\n\n- You can use your action to create a line of fire 15 feet long and 5 feet wide extending from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw.
