#:illithid.character.spell{:description "Choose one object weighing 1 to 5 pounds within range that isn't being worn or carried. The object flies in a straight line up to 90 feet in a direction you choose before falling to the ground, stopping early if it impacts against a solid surface. If the object would strike a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the object strikes the target and stops moving. In either case, both the object and the creature or solid surface take 3d8 bludgeoning damage.", :material-component nil, :ritual? false, :school :school/transmutation, :name "Catapult", :duration "Instantaneous", :level 1, :components #{:S}, :id :catapult, :casting-time "1 action", :classes #{:sorcerer :wizard}, :range "150 feet"}
