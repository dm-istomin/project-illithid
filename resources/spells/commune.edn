#:illithid.character.spell{:description "You contact your deity or a divine proxy and ask up to three questions that can be answered with a yes or no. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. You receive a correct answer for each question.\n\nDivine beings aren’t necessarily omniscient, so you might receive “unclear” as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity’s knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity’s interests, the DM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.\n\nIf you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer. The DM makes this roll in secret.", :material-component "Incense and a vial of holy or unholy water.", :ritual? true, :school :school/divination, :name "Commune", :duration "1 minute", :level 5, :components #{:M :V :S}, :id :commune, :casting-time "1 minute", :classes #{:cleric :ritual-caster :paladin}, :range "Self"}
