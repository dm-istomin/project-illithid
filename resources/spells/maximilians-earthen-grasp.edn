#:illithid.character.spell{:description "You choose a 5-foot-square unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within range. A Medium hand made from compacted soil rises there and reaches for one creature you can see within 5 feet of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained for the spell's duration.\n\nAs an action, you can cause the hand to crush the restrained target, who must make a Strength saving throw. It takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. To break out, the restrained target can make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer restrained by the hand.\n\nAs an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a restrained target if you do either.", :material-component "A miniature hand sculpted from clay.", :ritual? false, :school :school/transmutation, :name "Maximilian's Earthen Grasp", :duration "Up to 1 minute", :level 2, :components #{:M :V :S}, :id :maximilians-earthen-grasp, :casting-time "1 action", :classes #{:sorcerer :wizard}, :range "30 feet"}
