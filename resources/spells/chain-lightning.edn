Three bolts then leap from that target to as many as three other targets, each of which must be within 30 feet of the first target. A target can be a creature or an object and can be targeted by only one of the bolts.\n\nA target must make a dexterity saving throw. The target takes 10d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.", :material-component "A bit of fur; a piece of amber, glass, or a crystal rod; and three silver pins.", :ritual? false, :school :school/evocation, :name "Chain Lightning", :duration "Instantaneous", :level 6, :components #{:M :V :S}, :id :chain-lightning, :casting-time "1 action", :classes #{:sorcerer :wizard}, :range "150 feet"}
