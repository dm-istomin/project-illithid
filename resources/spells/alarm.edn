Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that wonâ€™t set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible.\n\nA mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.\n\nAn audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 60 feet.", :material-component "A tiny bell and a piece of fine silver wire.", :ritual? true, :school :school/abjuration, :name "Alarm", :duration "8 hours", :level 1, :components #{:M :V :S}, :id :alarm, :casting-time "1 minute", :classes #{:ranger :ritual-caster :wizard}, :range "30 feet"}
