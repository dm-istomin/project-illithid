Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you donâ€™t issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.\n\nThe DM has the creatures' statistics.", :material-component nil, :ritual? false, :school :school/conjuration, :name "Conjure Minor Elementals", :duration "Up to 1 hour", :level 4, :components #{:V :S}, :id :conjure-minor-elementals, :casting-time "1 minute", :classes #{:druid :wizard}, :range "90 feet"}
