#:illithid.character.spell{:description "The next time you make a ranged weapon attack during the spell’s duration, the weapon’s ammunition, or the weapon itself if it’s a thrown weapon, transforms into a bolt of lightning. Make the attack roll as normal. The target takes 4d8 lightning damage on a hit, or half as much damage on a miss, instead of the weapon’s normal damage.\n\nWhether you hit or miss, each creature within 10 feet of the target must make a dexterity saving throw. Each of these creatures takes 2d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nThe piece of ammunition or weapon then returns to its normal form.", :material-component nil, :ritual? false, :school :school/transmutation, :name "Lightning Arrow", :duration "Up to 1 minute", :level 3, :components #{:V :S}, :id :lightning-arrow, :casting-time "1 bonus action", :classes #{:ranger}, :range "Self"}
