#:illithid.character.spell{:description "A 20-foot-radius sphere of whirling air springs into existence centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere remains for the spell's duration. Each creature in the sphere when it appears or that ends its turn there must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 2d6 bludgeoning damage. The sphere's space is difficult terrain.\n\nUntil the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the center of the sphere toward one creature you choose within 60 feet of the center. Make a ranged spell attack. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is in the sphere. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 lightning damage.\n\nCreatures within 30 feet of the sphere have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to listen.", :material-component nil, :ritual? false, :school :school/evocation, :name "Storm Sphere", :duration "Up to 1 minute", :level 4, :components #{:V :S}, :id :storm-sphere, :casting-time "1 action", :classes #{:sorcerer :wizard}, :range "150 feet"}
