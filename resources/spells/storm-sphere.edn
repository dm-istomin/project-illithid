Make a ranged spell attack. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is in the sphere. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 lightning damage.</p><p>Creatures within 30 feet of the sphere have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to listen.</p>", :id :storm-sphere, :illithid.character.spell/range "150 feet", :illithid.character.spell/school :school/evocation}
