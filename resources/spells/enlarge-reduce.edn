Choose a creature or object that is not worn or carried. If the target does not consent, it can make a constitution saving throw. If successful, the spell has no effect.

If the target is a creature, everything she wears and carries with it change size. Any item dropped by the affected creature returns to its normal size.

Magnification. The double target in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This increases the size of a class of M to G for example. If there is not enough space in the room for the double target size, the creature or object reaches the maximum size possible in the available space. Until the end of the spell, the target also has the advantage of its jets Force and Force saves. Weapons to the target also grow. As long as these weapons are enlarged, the target's attacks cause additional 1d4 damage.

Reduction. The size of the target is reduced by half in all dimensions, and its weight is divided by eight. This reduction decreases the size of a class from M to P for example. Until the end of the spell, the target has a disadvantage to its jets Force and its Force saves. The weapons of the target shrink too. As long as these weapons are reduced, target attacks cause less damage 1d4 (minimum 1 point of damage).", :id :enlarge-reduce, :illithid.character.spell/range"30 feet", :illithid.character.spell/school :school/transmutation}
