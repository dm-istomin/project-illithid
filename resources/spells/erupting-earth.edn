#:illithid.character.spell{:description "Choose a point you can see on the ground within range. A fountain of churned earth and stone erupts in a 20-foot cube centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d12 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, the ground in that area becomes difficult terrain until cleared away. Each 5-foot-square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.", :material-component "A piece of obsidian.", :ritual? false, :school :school/transmutation, :name "Erupting Earth", :duration "Instantaneous", :level 3, :components #{:M :V :S}, :id :erupting-earth, :casting-time "1 action", :classes #{:druid :sorcerer :wizard}, :range "120 feet"}
