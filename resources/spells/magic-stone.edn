#:illithid.character.spell{:description "You touch one to three pebbles and imbue them with magic. You or someone else can make a ranged spell attack with one of the pebbles by throwing it or hurling it with a sling. If thrown, it has a range of 60 feet. If someone else attacks with the pebble, that attacker adds your spellcasting ability modifier, not the attacker's, to the attack roll. On a hit, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Hit or miss, the spell then ends on the stone.\n\nIf you cast this spell again, the spell ends early on any pebbles still affected by it.", :material-component nil, :ritual? false, :school :school/transmutation, :name "Magic Stone", :duration "1 minute", :level 0, :components #{:V :S}, :id :magic-stone, :casting-time "1 bonus action", :classes #{:druid :warlock}, :range "Touch"}
