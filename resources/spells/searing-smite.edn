At the start of each of its turns until the spell ends, the target must make a constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d6 fire damage. On a successful save, the spell ends. If the target or a creature within 5 feet of it uses an action to put out the flames, or if some other effect douses the flames (such as the target being submerged in water), the spell ends.</p>", :id :searing-smite, :illithid.character.spell/range "Self", :illithid.character.spell/school :school/evocation}
