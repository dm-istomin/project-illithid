#:illithid.character.spell{:description "A 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within range and lasts for the duration. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere must make a dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nAs a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. If you ram the sphere into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against the sphereâ€™s damage, and the sphere stops moving this turn.\n\nWhen you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. The sphere ignites flammable objects not being worn or carried, and it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.", :material-component "A bit of tallow, a pinch of brimstone, and a dusting of powdered iron.", :ritual? false, :school :school/conjuration, :name "Flaming Sphere", :duration "Up to 1 minute", :level 2, :components #{:M :V :S}, :id :flaming-sphere, :casting-time "1 action", :classes #{:cleric :druid :wizard}, :range "60 feet"}
