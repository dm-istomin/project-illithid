They float in the air and orbit you for the spell's duration. When you cast the spell - and as a bonus action on each of your turns thereafter-you can expend one or two of the meteors, sending them streaking toward a point or points you choose within 120 feet of you. Once a meteor reaches its destination or impacts against a solid surface, the meteor explodes. Each creature within 5 feet of the point where the meteor explodes must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>", :id :melfs-minute-meteors, :illithid.character.spell/range "Self", :illithid.character.spell/school :school/transmutation}
