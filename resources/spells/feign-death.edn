The target is blinded and incapacitated, and its speed drops to 0. The target has resistance to all damage except psychic damage. If the target is diseased or poisoned when you cast the spell, or becomes diseased or poisoned while under the spell’s effect, the disease and poison have no effect until the spell ends.", :material-component "A pinch of graveyard dirt.", :ritual? true, :school :school/necromancy, :name "Feign Death", :duration "1 hour", :level 3, :components #{:M :V :S}, :id :feign-death, :casting-time "1 action", :classes #{:cleric :druid :ritual-caster :wizard :bard}, :range "Touch"}
