If the object is in motion, you know the direction of its movement.\n\nThe spell can locate a specific object known to you, as long as you have seen it up close—within 30 feet—at least once. Alternatively, the spell can locate the nearest object of a particular kind, such as a certain kind of apparel, jewelry, furniture, tool, or weapon.\n\nThis spell can’t locate an object if any thickness of lead, even a thin sheet, blocks a direct path between you and the object.", :material-component "A forked twig.", :ritual? false, :school :school/divination, :name "Locate Object", :duration "Up to 10 minutes", :level 2, :components #{:M :V :S}, :id :locate-object, :casting-time "1 action", :classes #{:cleric :druid :ranger :wizard :paladin :bard}, :range "Self"}
