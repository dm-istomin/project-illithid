#:illithid.character.spell{:description "Until the spell ends, ice rimes your body, and you gain the following benefits:\n\n- You are immune to cold damage and have resistance to fire damage.\n\n- You can move across difficult terrain created by ice or snow without spending extra movement.\n\n- The ground in a 10-foot radius around you is icy and is difficult terrain for creatures other than you. The radius moves with you.\n\n- You can use your action to create a 15-foot cone of freezing wind extending from your outstretched hand in a direction you choose. Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails its save against this effect has its speed halved until the start of your next turn.", :material-component nil, :ritual? false, :school :school/transmutation, :name "Investiture of Ice", :duration "Up to 10 minutes", :level 6, :components #{:V :S}, :id :investiture-of-ice, :casting-time "1 action", :classes #{:druid :sorcerer :wizard :warlock}, :range "Self"}
