Up to ten willing creatures you can see within range gain this ability for the duration.\n\nIf you target a creature submerged in a liquid, the spell carries the target to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 60 feet per round.", :material-component nil, :ritual? true, :school :school/transmutation, :name "Water Walk", :duration "1 hour", :level 3, :components #{:M :V :S}, :id :water-walk, :casting-time "1 action", :classes #{:cleric :druid :ranger :sorcerer :ritual-caster}, :range "30 feet"}
