If the creature’s soul is free and willing, the creature is restored to life with all its hit points.\n\nThis spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures all diseases, and lifts any curses affecting the creature when it died. The spell replaces damaged or missing organs and limbs.\n\nThe spell can even provide a new body if the original no longer exists, in which case you must speak the creature’s name. The creature then appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 10 feet of you.", :material-component "A sprinkle of holy water and diamonds worth at least 25,000gp, which the spell consumes.", :ritual? false, :school :school/necromancy, :name "True Resurrection", :duration "Instantaneous", :level 9, :components #{:M :V :S}, :id :true-resurrection, :casting-time "1 hour", :classes #{:cleric :druid}, :range "Touch"}
