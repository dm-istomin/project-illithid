#:illithid.character.spell{:description "You create a vertical wall of whirling, razor-sharp blades made of magical energy. The wall appears within range and lasts for the duration. You can make a straight wall up to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or a ringed wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall provides three-quarters cover to creatures behind it, and its space is difficult terrain.\n\nWhen a creature enters the wallâ€™s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must make a dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 6d10 slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.", :material-component nil, :ritual? false, :school :school/evocation, :name "Blade Barrier", :duration "Up to 10 minutes", :level 6, :components #{:V :S}, :id :blade-barrier, :casting-time "1 action", :classes #{:cleric}, :range "90 feet"}
