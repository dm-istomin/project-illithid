A summoned creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which have their own turns.

If you don't issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.
